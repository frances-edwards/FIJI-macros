# FIJI-macros
Process microscopy images for visualisation and quantifications.

Mount_Images.ijm :

Generate channel composites and projections from multi-dimensional microscopy images saved as individual timepoint and channel files.
Allows to choose LUTs, projections.
Macro runs on file containing individual image files, including an nd file.
Output images saved in MountedImages folder.

ProjectionGeneration.ijm :

Generate z-projected single-channel xyt stacks from files generated with the JD lab spinning disc microscope.
Allows simple processing steps such as smoothing or bleach correction.
Can generate a 2-channel composite with choice from processed or unprocessed projected channels.
Macro runs on an experiment file that contains individual movie files. Each movie file contains a "Raw" file that contains the individual xyz stacks generated by metamorph.
Images saved in individual "PROJ" file contained in each movie file.

Spindle_kymo.ijm :

Generate 2-channel composite kymographs, with ROI moving from frame to frame.
On single channel movie, for each frame, draw ROI and add to ROI manager.
Save ROI manager when whole film done, in the same folder as 2-channel composite movie.
Run Spindle_kymo macro, choose 2-channel composite movie.
Outputs designed for kymos built in the C. elegans zygote mitotic spindle.
